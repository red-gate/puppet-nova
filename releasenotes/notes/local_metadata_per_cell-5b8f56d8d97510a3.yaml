    Indicates that the nova-metadata API service has been deployed
    per-cell, so that we can have better performance and data isolation in a
    multi-cell deployment. Users should consider the use of this configuration
    depending on how neutron is setup. If networks span cells, you might need
    to run nova-metadata API service globally. If your networks are segmented
    along cell boundaries, then you can run nova-metadata API service per cell.
    When running nova-metadata API service per cell, you should also configure
    each Neutron metadata-agent to point to the corresponding nova-metadata API
    service.
