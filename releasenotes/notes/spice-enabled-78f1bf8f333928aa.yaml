    Puppet-openstack now manages both [vnc]/enabled and [spice]/enabled. This
    was needed because Debian has [spice]/enabled set to True by default, and
    one cannot have both enabled in a compute node. Therefore, it was mandatory
    to have [spice]/enabled set to Flase if we're using VNC.
upgrade:
  - |
    Users of puppet-openstack will have to set ::nova::compute::spice_enabled to
    True to make a meaningful decisioin to use Spice and not use VNC, and not
    rely on ::nova::spicehtml5proxy or ::nova::compute::spice to set it as
    enabled by default.
