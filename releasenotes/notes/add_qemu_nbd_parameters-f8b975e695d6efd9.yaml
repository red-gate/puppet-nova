    Add support for native TLS encryption on NBD for disk migration

    The NBD protocol previously runs in clear text, offering no security
    protection for the data transferred, unless it is tunnelled over some
    external transport like SSH. Such tunnelling is inefficient and
    inconvenient to manage. Support for TLS to the NBD clients & servers
    provided by QEMU was added. This adds support to configure ndb related
    qemu.conf parameters.
