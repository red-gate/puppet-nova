    Add parameter `max_disk_devices_to_attach` that specifies
    max number of devices that can be attached to a single server.
    Note that the number of disks supported by an server depends
    on the bus used. For example, the ide disk bus is limited
    to 4 attached devices. The configured maximum is enforced
    during server create, rebuild, evacuate, unshelve, live migrate,
    and attach volume.
