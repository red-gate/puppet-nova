    Add cinder credentials in cinder section of nova conf to fix issue
    when reclaim_instance_interval > 0 and delete instance which booted
    from volume 'delete_on_termination' set as true. The volume status
    showing attached and in-use, even after instance deletion, since
    the admin context didn't have any token info hence call to cinder
    api failed.
    In case when context is is_admin and without token,added cinder creds
    used to do authentication with user/project info to call cinder api.
