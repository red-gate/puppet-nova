    Two new calsses nova::wsgi::wsgi_api and nova::wsgi::wsgi_api_metadata
    exist to allow configuring uwsgi in operating systems that support this
    (ie: currently Debian). This helps configuring the number of processes,
    threads, and listen socket. Please note that currently, nova does not
    support anything else than threads=1. Also, two new nova_api_uwsgi_config
    and nova_api_metadata_uwsgi_config provider now exist.
