deprecations:
  - |
    The nova scheduler baremetal Exact* filters and ironic host_manager
    have now been removed.
    As a result the following parameters are now deprecated and have
    no effect:

    ``nova::scheduler::filter::baremetal_scheduler_default_filter``
    ``nova::scheduler::filter::scheduler_use_baremetal_filters``
    ``nova::scheduler::filter::scheduler_host_manager``

    Baremetal scheduling will use the custom resource class defined for
    each baremetal node to make its selection. Refer to the ironic
    documentation for more details:
