upgrade:
  - |
    If you are setting ``libvirt_rbd_secret_uuid`` in the ``nova::compute::rbd``
    class you MUST now set ``libvirt_rbd_secret_key`` as well if the
    ``manage_libvirt_secret`` parameters is set to true (the default) because
    the ``rbd_keyring`` parameter is deprecated and has no effect, we no longer
    get the Ceph authx key automatically if ``libvirt_rbd_secret_key`` is not set.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``nova::compute::rbd::rbd_keyring`` parameter is deprecated and has
    no effect.
