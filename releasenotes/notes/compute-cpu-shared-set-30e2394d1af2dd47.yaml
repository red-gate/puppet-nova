    Add support for configuring cpu_shared_set

    Some workloads run best when the hypervisor overhead processes (emulator threads in libvirt/QEMU) can be placed on different physical host CPUs than other guest CPU resources. This allow
    those workloads to prevent latency spikes for guest vCPU threads. 

    To place a workload's emulator threads on a set of isolated physical CPUs, set the configuration option to the set of host CPUs that should be used for best-effort CPU resources. Then set
    a flavor extra spec to ``hw:emulator_threads_policy=share`` to instruct nova to place that workload's emulator threads on that set of host CPUs.
