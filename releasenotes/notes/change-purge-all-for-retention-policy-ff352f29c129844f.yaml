    This patch will add a new parameter (age) to define a
    retention policy when purging the Nova shadow tables.
    Also will add the parameter all_cells (defaulted to false)
    to run the purge command over the cells tables. 
fixes:
  - |
    Fix the default values to saner ones, this is because
    operators might run both the archive and the purge cron
    jobs. The defaults will make the purge job to run each
    day at 5 hours but the retention policy parameter will
    retain the data for 14 days.
