    enabled_apis won't get set in nova::api when
    nova_metadata_wsgi_enabled == true.
    But the enabled_apis list get also modified for this case, so
    we need to move setting the config outside the conditional.
    Since the config is right now also set in nova::metadata this
    deprecates it in nova::metadata to only use nova::api.
