    Correct permissions on the nova logfiles.
    If the ``nova-manage`` commands (such as dbsync) were initially run as
    root then subsequent runs as the nova user would fail as the logfile is
    owned by root (see `bug 1671681`_).
    The ownership of all nova logfiles is now checked before configuring
    nova, as a similar issue could prevent a service starting, and the
    nova-manage command is now run as the correct user.

    Adds nova::params::nova_user and nova::params::nova_group.
    nova::cron::archive_deleted_rows::user now defaults to
    nova::params::nova_user instead of hardcoding 'nova'
