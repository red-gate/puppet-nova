# == Class: nova::compute::libvirt_guests
#
# manages configuration for starting running instances when compute node
# gets rebooted.
#
# === Parameters:
#
# [*enabled*]
#   (optional) Whether the libvirt-guests service will be run
#   Defaults to false
#
# [*package_ensure*]
#   (optional) The state of libvirt packages
#   Defaults to 'present'
#
# [*on_boot*]
#   (optional) libvirt-guests parameter - action taken on host boot
#   - start  all guests which were running on shutdown are started on boot
#            regardless on their autostart settings
#   - ignore libvirt-guests init script won't start any guest on boot, however,
#            guests marked as autostart will still be automatically started by
#            libvirtd
#   Defaults to 'ignore'
#
# [*on_shutdown*]
#   (optional) libvirt-guests parameter - action taken on host shutdown
#   - suspend  all running guests are suspended using virsh managedsave
#   - shutdown all running guests are asked to shutdown. Please be careful with
#              this settings since there is no way to distinguish between a
#              guest which is stuck or ignores shutdown requests and a guest
#              which just needs a long time to shutdown. When setting
#              ON_SHUTDOWN=shutdown, you must also set SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT to a
#              value suitable for your guests.
#   Defaults to 'shutdown'
#
# [*shutdown_timeout*]
#   (optional) Number of seconds we're willing to wait for a guest to shut
#   down. If parallel shutdown is enabled, this timeout applies as a timeout
#   for shutting down all guests on a single URI defined in the variable URIS.
#   If this is 0, then there is no time out (use with caution, as guests might
#   not respond to a shutdown request). The default value is 300 seconds
#   (5 minutes).
#   Defaults to 300.
